MCP-SPI-EEPROM-Arduino
======================

This is a simple library without too many extra function so you can read and write to the 25XXYYY series of Microchip SPI EEProm chips. This is developed to work with the 25LC512 you may need to do a slight amount of  modification to get it to work with other chips in the series but it should be trivial to do. PULL requests welcome I will update it as need so if you want to use bigger or smaller chips just code it in and send me a pull request. Hope you find this useful!
